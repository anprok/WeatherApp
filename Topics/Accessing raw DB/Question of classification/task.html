<h2>Question of classification</h2>
<p>Scientists from Health.inc discovered that the virus <code class="java">A35B15</code> now should be classified differently; so the name must be changed to <code class="java">B36C16</code>. They've asked us to update their DB with the information about patients.</p>

<p>You need to write a program that updates the name of the virus.</p>

<p>Consider that the connection object is already created and is the <code class="java">conn</code> variable. The table's name is <code class="java">patients</code>. The table consists of two columns: <code class="java">name</code> and <code class="java">disease</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
