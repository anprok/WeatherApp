<h2>Poor granny</h2>
<p>There is an interesting employee at the Health.inc clinic — a 200-year-old woman. Sadly, she refuses to use the computer for work. She asked us to reorder in alphabetical order her hand-written notes to simplify her searching on paper.</p>

<p>You need to write a function that takes as an argument a list of tuples, inserts them in a DB, and then prints its contents ordered by names (the <code class="language-python">name</code> column) in alphabetical order. Note that each entry must be printed as tuple on the new line. Consider that the connection object is already created and is the <code class="language-python">conn</code> variable. The table's name is <code class="language-python">patients</code>.</p>

<p>Input list example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">[('Sarah', 'Covid-20'), ('Nick', 'A23N98'), ('Bob', 'Caries')]</code></pre>

<p>Output example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">('Bob', 'Caries')
('Nick', 'A23N98')
('Sarah', 'Covid-20')</code></pre><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
